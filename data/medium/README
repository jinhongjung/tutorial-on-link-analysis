Adolescent health network, part of the Koblenz Network Collection
===========================================================================

This directory contains the TSV and related files of the moreno_health network:

This directed network was created from a survey that took place in 1994/1995. Each student was asked to list his 5 best female and his 5 male friends. A node represents a student and an edge between two students shows that the left student chose the right student as a friend. Higher edge weights indicate more interactions and a edge weight shows that there is no common activity at all.


More information about the network is provided here:

Files:
    meta.moreno_health -- Metadata about the network
    out.moreno_health -- The adjacency matrix of the network in space separated values format, with one edge per line
      The meaning of the columns in out.moreno_health are:
        First column: ID of from node
        Second column: ID of to node
        Third column: edge weight
